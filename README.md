This is the public repository for the Easy Words app. It's a Flutter-based application for learning the English language designed for people who speak Ukrainian or Russian.

The app provides a unique approach to learning words that's both easy and fun by using associations. It's a subscription-based app that's currently available on both the App Store and Google Play.

The app allows users to select 5 new words every day and discover their association with text and images. It also includes a few features that allow users to create their own associations for words and store them in the repository.

The app is developed using Hive database for storing data, Riverpod for state management, and follows the MVVM architecture.
